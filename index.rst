Welcome to farsi-lab's documentation!
=====================================

Farsi-lab is a selection of scripts and programs developed by Alessandro
Farsi (af342@cornell.edu) for scientific and hobbistic purposes.

Most of the programs come as scripts, with as little dependency as possible,
Each file can just be copy around, changed and duplicated (this is how we do
in the lab)
